# Stickerbook expected spend
This is a tool primarily aimed at those completing the Math-Off 2020 Sticker Book (http://mathoffstickerbook.com). It computes the average spend for generation 12 packs to obtain a single copy of sticker number 550, and similarly for other generations.

Credits to @PaulsPrattle for originally asking the question on Twitter (https://twitter.com/PaulsPrattle/status/1285454442117177346?s=20), and @mscroggs and @icecolbeveridge for their attempts at answering this question, which prompted me to verify their working out. Data on cost, pack size and number of stickers to collect for each generation was gathered from the Woolly Thoughts Ravelry Group.

The tool currently works for generations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and hedgehog (the last one refers to the hedgehog stickers).
